# Portfolio
In the past two years of my learning jounrey in AI, I have completed more than 10 projects individually and in a team using skills ranging from Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Multivariate Data Analysis, and Natural Language Processing. Please refer to the following linked-projects for more details.

### Individual Projects
### I) [Sign Language Recognition Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/suetteh/SignLanguageRecognition)	(Aug-Nov 2023) 
•	Applied MediaPipe Holistic model to detect dynamic gestures which include face, hands, and pose landmarks detection.

### II) [Detect COVID-19 and Pneumonia using Chest X-ray and Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/suetteh/Chest-X-ray-Classification) (Aug- Nov 2023)
•	Compared conventional, separable and grouped convolutional neural network in classifying chest X-ray to COVID-19, Pneumonia and normal classes.

### III) [Optimize University Part-time Programs Scheduling Using Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/suetteh/ScheduleOptimizationUsingGeneticAlgorithm) (May-July 2023)
•	Applied Genetic Algorithm by optimizing course scheduling for three part-time Master programmes offered by Asia Pacific University to minimize cost spending while maximize the benefits for students.

### IV) [Smoking Status Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/suetteh/SmokingStatusPrediction) (Jan-Mar 2023)
•	Compared the performance of Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting models in predicting smoking status using more than 55,000 observations and 27 variables.

### Group
### [NLP, Spelling Errors Detection System] (https://github.com/suetteh/NLP) (May-July 2023)
•	Developed a system which can detect non-words and real-words errors by using minimum edit distance.
